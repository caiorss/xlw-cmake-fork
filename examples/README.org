Contains XLW framework example projects, managed by CMake, for creating Excel XLL Addins.

Note 1: Not all projects have been converted to CMake yet. To build a
project, it is just necessary to have MSVC-2017 development tools and
CMake. Projects can built without IDE by running the batch script
build.bat or by clicking at them.

Note 2: XLL Addins are shared libraries, so, if the current Excel
version is 64 bits, the XLL addin must be compiled for 64 bits
target. If the Excel version is 32 bits, the XLL addin must also be
compiled for 32 bits target, otherwise, Excel will not be able to load
the addin.

The Addins have been configured for 32 bits target.
